# PythonSnakeGame

This is my attempt at the snake game. I stated By creating the graph window of where the snake woudl live. Then I added instructions that load up when the game starts so you know what to do. 
Then added a createsnake function so we can call the snake from the main. Move function so the snake moves around in a 2D enviorment. After that
I added a checkBounds function which check constantly if the snake is still in the bounds that is allowed to be in if it touches itself or
reaches a edge in the windows you will loose. Still currently working on the grow function. I also have a newApple function which created a square at a random postition for for to adquire. 
Then at the end I addded the main Function which calls all the functions described above making the snake game a reality.

You can also find in the second branch another proyect which would be the same. And the third branch is the game working with a class.
